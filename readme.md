# JavaScript is not a typed Language.

You don't have to specify what type of data will be stored in a variable. JavaScript automatically detects the data type based on what information you are assign to it. 

The Typed languages (like Java, C#) need to declare the variable's type and can't be changed. 

"This is both a blessing and a curse" because this flexibility can helps us to protect us from spend hours debugging something because a type error.
